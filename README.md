# Hi, I'm Florian 👋

I'm a DevSecOps Engineer working at [**cluetec GmbH**](https://cluetec.de), a german software company placed in Karlruhe. Since the early 2010s I'm working as a software developer and since 2018 also in the DevSecOps area. I mainly work in the field of web development (frontend, as well as backend) and especially like to focus on the operational part.

In the early 2010s, I completed an **apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development** (in german "Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung") at an internet agency. Afterwards, I started my **studies in business informatics** at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences (in german "Hochschule Karlsruhe") and graduated with a **master's degree** in 2021. Since then I have been working full time as a DevSecOps Engineer at [**cluetec GmbH**](https://cluetec.de), where I am involved in cloud migration and several customer projects.
