I'm a DevSecOps Engineer working at [**cluetec GmbH**](https://cluetec.de), a German software company located in Karlruhe. Since the early 2010s, I've been working as a software developer, and since 2018, I've also been in the DevSecOps area. I mainly work in the field of web development (frontend as well as backend) and especially like to focus on the operational part.

In the early 2010s, I completed an **apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development** (in German: "Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung") at an internet agency. Afterwards, I started my **studies in business informatics** at the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences and graduated with a **master's degree** in 2021. Since then, I have been working full time as a DevSecOps Engineer at [**cluetec GmbH**](https://cluetec.de), where I am involved in cloud migration and several customer projects.
